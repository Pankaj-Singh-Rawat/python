# 📂 Repository Structure
The project is organized into modular directories, each focusing on a specific domain of Python development.

## 1. Fundamentals
The bedrock of the language. This section covers everything from "Hello World" to complex architectural patterns.

Basics: Variables, Data Types, Strings, and Operators.

Control Flow: Functions, Iterators, and Exception Handling.

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming): Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Constructors.

Advanced Logic: Regular Expressions (RegEx) and Global Scoping.

## 2. Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
Focuses on computational efficiency and the logic behind organizing data.

Linear Structures: Stacks, Queues, and Linked Lists.

Searching: Linear and Binary Search implementations.

Sorting: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, and Quick Sort.

Array Techniques: Kadane’s Algorithm and Sliding Window strategies.

## 3. Numerical Computing (NumPy)
Extensive implementation of multidimensional arrays and statistical distributions.

Mathematical Distributions: Pareto, Zipf, Chi-Square, Exponential, and Rayleigh.

Ufuncs: Universal functions for fast element-wise array operations.

## 4. Data Analysis (Pandas)
Focused on data wrangling and manipulation using structured datasets.

Includes exercise_data.csv and data.csv for practical analysis.
