# texts are supposed to be inside "here" or 'here' 
print("hello world ")


# to print multiple things on the same line we can use end
print("hello", end = " ")
print("world!")

# to print numbers we do not need to use any quotes we can just write
print(5000) 

# we can also mix text and numbers like this 
print("my name is Pankaj, and I was born in", 2004, "glad to meet you!" )
